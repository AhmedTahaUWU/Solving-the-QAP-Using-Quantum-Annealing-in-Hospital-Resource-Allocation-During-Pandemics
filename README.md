# Quantum Optimization

## Overview

This project explores quantum optimization techniques using a combination of quantum algorithms and classical methods. It aims to provide an understanding of optimization problems that can benefit from quantum computing paradigms, showcasing their application through examples in this notebook.

## Files

- **Quantum_Optimization.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Code implementations of quantum optimization techniques.
  - Explanatory markdown cells to guide the user through the concepts and steps.
  - Example runs demonstrating the optimization processes.

## How to Run the Codebase

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the notebook:

- **Python** (>= 3.8)
- **Qiskit** (>= 0.43.1): A library for working with quantum circuits and quantum algorithms.
- **NumPy** (>= 1.22.0): For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** (>= 3.5.0): For visualizing the results.

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install qiskit numpy matplotlib
```

### Running the Notebook
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file `Quantum_Optimization.ipynb`.
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Quantum_Optimization.ipynb
   ```
3. Execute the cells sequentially to follow the implementation and examples.

## Examples

### Example 1: Solving a Simple Optimization Problem
The notebook demonstrates solving a basic optimization problem, such as maximizing a simple quadratic function using quantum techniques. After running the relevant cells, you might see output like this:

```
Optimal solution: [1.0, -1.0]
Optimal value: -2.0
```

### Example 2: Visualizing Quantum Circuits
The notebook also visualizes the quantum circuit used in the optimization process. For instance, a cell might generate a circuit diagram similar to this:

```
     ┌───┐
q_0: ┤ H ├──■──
     └───┘  │
q_1: ───────■──
```

The visualization provides insights into how quantum states are manipulated during computation.
